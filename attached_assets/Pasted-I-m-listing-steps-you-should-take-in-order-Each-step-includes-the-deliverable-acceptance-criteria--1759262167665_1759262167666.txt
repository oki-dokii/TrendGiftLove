I’m listing steps you should take in order. Each step includes the deliverable/acceptance criteria (no timelines — you can attach them later).

Define scope & personas

Deliverable: short doc with target users (e.g., young professionals, parents, spouses), top 3 use cases, prioritized features (MVP vs later).

Design UX & core flows

Deliverable: wireframes for: input form, results card, save-to-bucket, idea detail, message generator modal.

Draft AI prompts & output schema

Deliverable: tested prompts for idea generation + message templates that return consistent JSON.

Build backend skeleton + DB

Deliverable: auth, events, product and gift_ideas tables, basic API endpoints.

Seed curated content

Deliverable: 200–500 curated products/templates across occasions & budgets (manual curation improves initial quality).

Integrate at least one product API / affiliate feed

Deliverable: working connector to one reliable feed (product search endpoint + link).

Add AI orchestration

Deliverable: backend service calling GPT prompts, merging AI output with product results, returning final JSON to frontend.

Frontend MVP

Deliverable: functional UI where users enter inputs → get suggestions → save items.

Implement bucket list + reminders

Deliverable: users can save items, set reminders, and receive notification (email initially).

Quality & safety check, legal review

Deliverable: privacy policy, affiliate disclosure, review of scraping legality.

Beta testing with users

Deliverable: recruit 20–50 users for feedback; collect qualitative feedback & quantitative metrics.

Iterate ranking & UX

Deliverable: improved relevance scoring, A/B tested copy for suggestion cards, better templates.

Add monetization & analytics

Deliverable: affiliate links live, tracking clicks / saves / buys, revenue dashboard.

Scale: multiple feeds, caching, price refresh workers

Deliverable: reliable product freshness, price history, multi-source redundancy.

Growth & integrations

Deliverable: WhatsApp/Instagram sharing, local language support, personalized recommendations learned from user saves
